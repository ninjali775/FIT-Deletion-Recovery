# FIT-Deletion-Recovery
**Forensics Investigation Team Demonstrates how to Recover Deleted Files using Foremost on Linux
**

If you have important files that got deleted, you can digitally recover these files using a program called Foremost. 

For our project, we, the Forensics Investigation Team (F.I.T.), created a ZIP file that contains a toolkit for recovering lost files. Our ZIP file includes a guide to using Foremost as well as a virtual disk image. You can find the link to our ZIP file at the end of this README.md. 

When you extract our ZIP file, you will find a guide with the filename, "How to Recovered Deleted Files.". We made our guide in the form of an infographic, and it contains step-by-step instructions on how to use Foremost to recover a deleted image. In the ZIP file you will also find a virtual disk image with the filename, "forensics-investigators-kali-linux.ova". Please download this virtual disk image onto your computer to access it in your Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager. You may need to install the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager before attempting to open this virtual machine. 

Feel free to use the virtual machine we created to practice your deletion-and-recovery skills. For more information on our team's mini deletion-and-recovery exercise, please click on the README.txt icon that we saved in the hard drive of the VDI to begin the exercise. Good luck!
