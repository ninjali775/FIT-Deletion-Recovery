**Forensics Investigation Team Demonstrates how to Recover Deleted Files using Foremost on Linux
**

If you have important files that got deleted on your machine, you can recover them using the Linux command-line and a program called Foremost. 

For our project, we, the Forensics Investigation Team (F.I.T.), created a ZIP file that contains a toolkit for recovering lost files. The ZIP includes a guide to using Foremost and a virtual disk image. You can find the link to our ZIP at the end of this README.md. After extracting the ZIP file, you will find our guide called "How to Recovered Deleted Files.", in the form of an infographic, that contains step-by-step instructions on how to recover a deleted image using Foremost. Inside the ZIP, you will also find a virtual disk image (forensics-investigators-kali-linux.ova) that you can download onto an Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager and use to practice your deletion-and-recovery skills. Once you open the virtual machine we created, please click on the README.txt icon located on the machine's Desktop to begin a mini deletion-and-recovery exercise. Good luck!
