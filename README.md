**Forensics Investigation Team Demonstrates how to Recover Deleted Files using Foremost on Linux
**

If you have files that got deleted on your machine, you can recover them using the Linux command-line and a program called Foremost. 

Our team created the ZIP file below to provide you a toolkit to practice your deletion-and-recovery skills. When you download the ZIP, you will find a guide, in the form of an infographic, that shows you step-by-step how to recover a deleted image using Foremost and a virtual disk image (forensics-investigators-kali-linux.ova) you can download onto your VirtualBox Manager. After you open our virtual machine, read the README.txt that we pasted onto the Desktop to start a mini deletion-and-recovery exercise.

Download our ZIP here and start recovering files:
