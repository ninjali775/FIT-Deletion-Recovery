**Forensics Investigation Team Demonstrates how to Recover Deleted Files using Foremost on Linux
**

If you have important files that got deleted on your machine, you can recover them using the Linux command-line and a program called Foremost. 

Our team, the Forensics Investigation Team (F.I.T.), created a ZIP file, which you can find at the end of this README.md, to provide you a toolkit that will help you recover your own deleted files. When you download the ZIP, you will find a guide, in the form of an infographic, which shows you step-by-step how to recover a deleted image using Foremost. The ZIP also includes a virtual disk image (forensics-investigators-kali-linux.ova) which you can download onto your Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager to practice your deletion-and-recovery skills. After you download forensics-investigators-kali-linux.ova and open the virtual machine we created, please click on the README.txt icon located in the Desktop to begin a mini deletion-and-recovery exercise. Good luck!
